Genotype data on Covid:
covid1_22.bed
covid1_22.bim
covid1_22.fam

#GWAS results on stroke (all variants with p<0.05):

strokegwasresults_p5.txt

#Fam file for the same people but with melanoma status:

melanoma1_22.fam

#Read the stroke GWAS data into R so we can convert it into the right format to calculate a PRS

gwas<-read.table(file="strokegwasresults.txt",header=T)

#Convert the effect sizes (currently odds ratios) into betas/log odds ratios (by logging these)

#Then write out the columns with the SNP ID (rs number), allele (A1) and beta/log odds ratio to a file
#Only include those SNPs with a p-value beyond some threshold (e.g. p<10^-6).
#This way the PRS includes a high proportion of genuinely associated SNPs.

#We can use this file to create a polygenic risk score for risk of stroke for every person in the dataset 
#based on a specific level of significance

#So the first few lines will look like:

rs291875965  T  1.2911592
1:2009548_GC_G  G -0.4704837
rs1100738283  A  4.0267792
rs157026489  A  0.2303178
rs1113507113  T  1.6331544

#Repeat this creating files with different p-value cutoffs for inclusion

#Then use these to calculate polygenic risk scores for each person. E.g.:

plink --bfile covid1_22 --score prs.txt --out score

#Where prs.txt is the file you just created from the GWAS results.
#The output file for this will have the PRS for each person in the file score.profile

#Repeat this for all the files you created at different p-value cutoffs

#Then read the results into R:

score<-read.table(file="score.profile",header=T)

#You can then regress Covid case/control status on the stroke PRS (remembering that case=2 and control=1 but R needs case=1 and control=0):

resall<-glm((score[,3]-1)~score[,6],family=binomial)

#There are two useful measures to get from this - the p-value and the pseudo R^2
#The p-value tells us whether the stroke PRS is associated with risk of Covid
#The pseudo R^2 is a measure of the variation in Covid risk explained by the PRS for stroke

#p-values from:
summary(resall)
#pseudo R^2 from:
1-(summary(resall)$deviance)/summary(resall)$null.deviance


#Repeat this for the different PRS (at different p-value cutoffs) you have created

#See what happens when you include sex as a covariate. Read in the fam file to get this:

famm<-read.table(file="covid1_22.fam",header=F)
names(famm)[c(1,5)]<-c("FID","SEX")

#and use the 'merge' command to combine with the score file

scoresex<-merge(score,famm[,c(1,5)])

#Then run the regression again with sex included:

resall<-glm((scoresex[,3]-1)~scoresex[,7]+scoresex[,6],family=binomial)
summary(resall)
1-(summary(resall)$deviance)/summary(resall)$null.deviance

#melanoma1_22.fam is for the same people but has case/control status for melanoma in column 6 (rather than stroke).
#Read it into R and merge with your PRS file (score) to see whether the stroke PRS is associated with melanoma risk
